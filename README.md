Countdown 2 hours for that amazing presentation
about Prezi!!! I literally have no idea whay Prezi is 
but I can't to find out all about it...

Pretzl are tasty, but so salty?
I think that salt is actually made of pretzl.
Further investigation needed...

I didn't try the pretzl but i would be try it.
Is that is sweet or not?
If is that salty and sweet then i would be try it.
